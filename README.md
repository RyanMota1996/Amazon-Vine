## Conlcusion and Summary
with our current data set it is not possible to come to any clear conclusion. With so few vine members reveiwing games it is impossible to say one way or the the other, and any conclusion i make would be supported bad erroneous in the exterme. If we wish for more people to reveiw vine products it would be best to reach out to influences to push the service or have it advertised more prominently. Furthermore a study that can be conducted on people who are purchasing games is if they have ever heard of the amazon vine service in the first place, as many probably never have come across it.
